# Peer Review Triage

A peer team lead reviewed the code and provided findings below.

Context:
- They have less context than we do (history + decisions)
- You are the team lead — do not accept findings at face value
- Your job is to verify, classify, and decide what to do

Peer findings:
[PASTE FEEDBACK]

---

## Rules

- Be skeptical, not defensive
- Verify using actual code evidence when possible
- Do not reopen locked decisions unless explicitly asked
- Prefer minimal fixes over refactors

---

## For EACH finding

1) **Restate the claim** in your own words (1 line)
2) **Evidence check**
   - File/area: [path or module]
   - Does it exist? ✅ / ❌ / ❓ (unverifiable)
   - Evidence: [short quote or description of relevant code]
3) **If invalid**
   - Explain why (misread, already handled, decision mismatch)
4) **If valid**
   - Severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
   - Impact: [security / data / UX / perf / maintainability]
   - Smallest fix: [one concrete approach]
   - Add to fix plan (yes/no)

---

## Output

### ✅ Confirmed Findings
- [Finding] — [Severity] — [File/area] — [Smallest fix]

### ❌ Invalid / Not Applicable
- [Finding] — Why it’s invalid / decision mismatch / already handled

### ❓ Unverifiable (Needs Info)
- [Finding] — What’s missing (file/line, repro steps, environment)

### 📌 Prioritized Action Plan
1. [CRITICAL/HIGH] …
2. [MEDIUM] …
3. [LOW] …
