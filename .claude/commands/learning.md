# Learning Mode

Pause execution and planning.
Switch to **understanding-first mode**.

The goal is to deepen understanding of a concept relevant to the current work — not to implement or refactor anything yet.

---

## Audience & Intent

- You are a **design-led product builder** who ships production software with AI assistance
- Your strengths are UX, product judgment, and systems thinking
- You can read code and reason about architecture
- You are deepening technical fluency to make better product and design decisions

This is not beginner material and not academic engineering theory.

---

## When to Use This Mode

Use `/learning` when:
- A technical concept affects product or UX quality
- You need to reason about tradeoffs, not just “what works”
- Something feels important but under-explained
- You want to build intuition, not just follow instructions

Do not use this for generic or disconnected theory.

---

## Teaching Philosophy

- Apply the **80/20 rule** — focus on ideas that compound
- Explain *why things are designed this way*, not just how
- Be honest about complexity (“this is tricky because…”)
- Anchor explanations to **product impact and UX implications**
- Connect technical choices back to user experience when relevant

---

## Three-Level Explanation

Present the concept in **three levels**, in order.

### Level 1 — Core Concept
- What this is and why it exists
- The product or UX problem it solves
- When you’d reach for it
- How it fits into the overall system

### Level 2 — How It Works
- The mechanics underneath
- Key tradeoffs and why this approach is commonly chosen
- Edge cases that affect user experience or reliability
- How to debug or reason about failures

### Level 3 — Deep Dive
- Implementation details that influence real-world behavior
- Performance, scaling, and UX implications
- Related patterns and when to prefer alternatives
- The “senior engineer” mental model behind this

---

## Constraints

- Stay grounded in the current product context
- Do not drift into abstract theory for its own sake
- Do not propose code changes unless explicitly asked

---

## Exit Criteria

This learning pass is complete when:
- I can explain the concept in my own words
- I understand the tradeoffs well enough to make a design or product decision
- I know what matters and what I can safely ignore for now

If helpful, end with:
- “What I should remember”
- “What I can ignore”
