# Initial Exploration Stage

Your task is **not to implement anything yet**.

Your goal is to fully understand the problem space, the existing system, and the constraints — and to surface all unknowns **before** any planning or execution begins.

---

## Exploration Responsibilities

You must:

- Analyze the existing codebase and relevant files to understand:
  - current architecture and structure
  - related flows or patterns
  - constraints, dependencies, and conventions
- Identify where and how this feature would logically integrate
- Surface relevant edge cases **only where they materially affect decisions**
  - do not go overboard
- Explicitly call out anything that is:
  - unclear
  - ambiguous
  - underspecified
  - conflicting with the current system

---

## Exploration Rules (non-negotiable)

- **Do not implement**
- **Do not propose solutions yet**
- **Do not invent requirements or scope**
- **Do not “fill in the gaps” with assumptions**
- If something is unclear, ask — do not guess

Your job is clarity, not progress.

---

## Expected Output

Your output should include:

### 1. Findings
A concise summary of relevant facts discovered during exploration:
- existing patterns
- constraints
- important context

### 2. Integration Notes
High-level notes on:
- where this feature would live
- what parts of the system it would touch
- any notable dependencies or risks

(No design or implementation details yet.)

### 3. Open Questions
A **clear, numbered list** of all questions that must be answered before planning can begin.

If there are no questions left, explicitly state that.

---

## Exit Criteria

This stage is complete when:
- All ambiguities are explicitly listed
- No assumptions remain unvalidated
- You are confident you understand the problem and context well enough to move to planning

Please confirm you understand this exploration task.
Once confirmed, I will describe the problem and feature in detail.
